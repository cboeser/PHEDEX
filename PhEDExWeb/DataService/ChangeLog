* Changes for 1.6.0

 New APIs:
  * 'agentlogs': recent messages from the agents
  * 'blocktests': results of block consistency checks
  * 'deletions': block deletion queue & recently completed deletions
  * 'routedblocks': statistics for currently routed blocks

 Changes for APIs:

  * 'auth':
    - enabled password-based authentication.  No API allows use of
      this authenticatio at the moment, however.
    - Add 'username' attribute, the hypernews username, when it is
      available
    - Add 'human_name' attribute, the requestor's normal name
  * 'subscribe': now sends out email notifications (#51644)

 Bugfixes for APIs:

  * 'errorlog': bugfix to show multiple errors per file when they exist (#61639)
  * 'inject': internal SQL changes to reduce chance of lock contention
  * 'inject' & 'subscribe': HTTP POST is the only accepted mehtod
  * 'subscriptions':
    - default result is subscritions created within the last 24 hours
    - bugfix: 'dataset' filter when used with other options (#58805)
  * Internal changes to the way data is served to reduce memory use on
    the server.  Data is now "spooled" to the client in discrete
    chunks.  The output format is unchanged.  The following APIs are
    spooling-enabled: agentlogs, blockreplicas, dashboardhistory,
    errorlog, errorlogsummary, filereplicas, missingfiles,
    nodeusagehistory, routerhistory, transferhistory,
    transferqueuehistory

* Changes for 1.5.2

  * Bug fix for previous bug fix, which caused all API arguments to be
    ignored.

* Changes for 1.5.1

  * Bug fix for all APIs: Empty arguments 'e.g. api?name=' are removed
    from the argument list. This fixes a bug where some APIs would
    generate a large request (all possible data) when some argement
    should have been required.

* Changes for 1.5.0

 New APIs:

  * routerhistory - history of router activity and input parameters
  * nodeusagehistory - history of space usage at a node
  * links - existing transfer links and their state
  * missingfiles - which files are missing from a block
  * subscriptions - existing subscriptions and their parameters

 Changes for APIs:

  * blockreplicas, filereplicas - now return blocks which have zero
    file replicas, but are subscribed.  Useful for calculating data
    remaining to be transferred.

 Bug Fixes for APIs:

  * fix URI case for logical operatior toggle (op:$name=and,
    op:$name=or).  Now $name is specified in lowercase.

* Changes for 1.4.2

 Bug Fixes for APIs:

  * lfn2pfn, nodes - fix bug where 'node=' option was ignored,
    returning all results

 Etc.:

  * Pipe log output to rotatelogs
  * Safer 'httpd' start/stop script, which doesn't kill httpd
    processes that are not the data service

* Changes for 1.4.1

 New APIs:

 * groups - list of groups known to PhEDEx

 Changes for APIs:

  * blockreplicas, filereplicas - add 'subscribed' filter option and
    output value, for indicating whether or not the replica is
    subscribed
  * inject - allow multiple checksums for files (adler32 and cksum)

 Bug Fixes for APIs:

  * transferhistory - bug localtime/gmtime bug when specifying string
    timestamps in options

 Etc.:

  * allow "Store Results" => "DataOps" SiteDB role to inject and
    subscribe
  * minor documentation fixes

* Changes for 1.4.0

 New APIs:

  * agents - Serves information about running (or at least recently
    running) PhEDEx agents.
  * dashboardhistory - transferhistory for the Dashboard (see below)
  * deleterequests - Serves information about deletion requests,
    including the data requested for deletion, the client who created
    the request, and the clients who approved or disapproved the
    request.
  * groupusage - Serves storage statistics for each node per group.
  * nodeusage - A summary of how space is used on a node.
  * errorlog - Serves transfer error details from the
    database log
  * errorlogsummary - Summary about logged errors.  (what has logs)
  * transferhistory - Serves historical statistics about completed
    transfer attempts.
  * transferqueueblocks - Serves blocks in the transfer queue, along
    with their state.
  * transferqueuefiles - Serves files in the transfer queue, along
    with their state.
  * transferqueuehistory - Serves historical statistics about
    transfer queues.
  * transferqueuestats - Serves state details for links currently in
    use.
  * transferrequests - Serves transfer request information, including
    the data requested, the requesting client, the approving clients,
    and the request options.

 Updates to existing APIs:

  * filereplicas - New option 'lfn', for looking up which nodes have
    a file.
  * linktasks API removed, use transferqueuestats instead.

 General changes:

  * Serve an <error> if client certificate is not found in SiteDB,
    instead of serving an HTML sign-up web page.
  * Fix growing /doc path when browsing documentation.
  * Correctly encode unsafe XML characters.
  * For element text data in the XML format, wrap in a CDATA construct
  * Hide 'X' nodes wherever nodes are found, except history APIs
  * Change authn roles for inject, subscribe to 'T0 Operator' of group
    'DataOps'
  * Fix caching via mod_cache
  * Documentation updates

* Versions < 1.4.0

The data service was born out of a need to integrate with other CMS
services.  The primary APIs were blockreplicas, for turning PhEDEx
into the Data Location Service (DLS), and inect, subscribe, which were
used for automating these actions for the Tier-0.

Original APIs:

  auth			check authentication
  blockreplicas		finds blocks at nodes
  bounce		echos arguments; for testing
  filereplicas		finds files at nodes
  inject		inject data to TMDB from an XML file
  lfn2pfn		convert LFNs to PFNs from TFC in TMDB
  linktasks		task status summary
  nodes			list nodes
  subscribe		make and approve a transfer request from an XML file
  tfc			show the TFC used by a node
