The data service was born out of a need to integrate with other CMS
services.  The primary APIs were blockreplicas, for turning PhEDEx
into the Data Location Service (DLS), and inect, subscribe, which were
used for automating these actions for the Tier-0.

Original APIs:

  auth			check authentication
  blockreplicas		finds blocks at nodes
  bounce		echos arguments; for testing
  filereplicas		finds files at nodes
  inject		inject data to TMDB from an XML file
  lfn2pfn		convert LFNs to PFNs from TFC in TMDB
  linktasks		task status summary
  nodes			list nodes
  subscribe		make and approve a transfer request from an XML file
  tfc			show the TFC used by a node
