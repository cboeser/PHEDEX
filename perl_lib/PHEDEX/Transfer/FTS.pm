# Check whether a job is alive.
#
# This periodically checks every FTS copy job for current transfer
# status, and "reaps" the tasks that have reached FTS "end state".
#
# We avoid checking on jobs excessively frequently as the front-end
# agent calls this routine up to every 15 seconds.  Each copy job
# maintains a marker file that marks the time we should next poll 
# the job status.
#
# Once an individual file has reached an end state, we create the
# T<TASKID>X file for the task with all the information about the
# transfer for that task.  The front-end agent will automatically
# reap those transfers, and once all transfers for the job have
# completed, it will automatically clean up the whole copy job.
#
# If the check reveals that transfer state has transitioned from 
# Pending to Active the timeout should be reset to 0, so as to avoid
# cutting off active transfers while they are onging. This means a 
# transfer will have an hour to become active, and an hour to complete.
